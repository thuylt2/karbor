*****************
Mission Statement
*****************

To protect the Data and Metadata that comprises an OpenStack-deployed
Application against loss/damage (e.g. backup, replication) by providing a
standard framework of APIs and services that allows vendors to provide plugins
through a unified interface

Open Architecture
"""""""""""""""""

Design for multiple perspectives:

* User: Protect App Deployment

  * Configure and manage custom protection plans on the deployed resources
    (topology, VMs, volumes, images, â€¦)

* Admin: Define Protectable Resources

  * Decide what plugins protect which resources, what is available for the user
  * Decide where users can protect their resources

* Vendors: Standard API for protection products

  * Create plugins that implement Protection mechanisms for different OpenStack
    resources
